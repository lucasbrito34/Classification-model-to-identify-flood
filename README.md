# Classification-model-to-identify-flood
Article source code: "FLORAS:  Assessing  Urban  FLash-flood  Risk  Using  a Multivariate Model"

This article develops a multivariate model for flood detection that has machine learning and a heterogeneous database.

## Dependencies

### Installation
* python 3.4 (Data preprocessing)
* Weka: Weka is tried and tested open source machine learning software that can be accessed through a graphical user interface, standard terminal applications, or a Java API. (visit https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ for more informations)

## How to develop the model?

### Step 1

Installation of the **Weka** tool that aggregates algorithms from different approaches / paradigms in the sub-area of artificial intelligence dedicated to the study of **machine learning** and also python 3.4 for Data preprocessing before training and validation.

## Step 2

Preprocessing of data with treatment of missing values, balancing of the data and also aggregation of heterogeneous data available in this Git in the folder Pre_ Processamento

## Step 3

In this step it is time to configure the parameters of the algorithms that are described in the article in the Weka tool and run the database already processed and develop and evaluate the model that identifies the flood.
